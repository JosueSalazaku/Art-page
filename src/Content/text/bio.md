# Biotext:

 I'm Josu√© Salazaku, an artist originally from Angola, now based in Belgium since the age of 3. My work is deeply rooted in personal and cultural identity, with my family playing a central role in shaping my creative voice. While Angola as a place may not be the primary subject of my art, the people and the cultural heritage they carry are a powerful source of inspiration in my practice.
