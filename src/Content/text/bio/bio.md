# **Biotext:**
I'm Josu√© Salazaku, an artist originally from Angola, now based in Belgium since the age of 3. My work is deeply rooted in personal and cultural identity, with my family playing a central role in shaping my creative voice. While Angola as a place may not be the primary subject of my art, the people and the cultural heritage they carry are a powerful source of inspiration in my practice.


# **Art influence on society:**
<h>I don't create art with the sole intention of influencing society. For me, it's a deeply personal form of self-expression and exploration. Painting is a way for me to understand myself and navigate my emotions. It's a space where I can be vulnerable, even though that vulnerability can be scary at times. While it's great if people appreciate my work, my primary focus is on using art as a means to connect with my inner self.<h/>
